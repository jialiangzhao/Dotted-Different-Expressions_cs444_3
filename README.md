## References
Suppose the full score of sat is 800 and the lowest score is 0. But I realized that there is no 0 in the data. This means that our chart has a lot of vacancies, so I tried to put the leftmost score instead of 0, but 400. Because the lowest score is around 400. The whole picture is enlarged because of my changes. This is my change, but I don't know how to use scatterplot_2b to express the zooming operation.
